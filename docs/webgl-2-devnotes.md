### Key WebGL 2.0 Improvements Explained 

#### Tips to consider for shaders:

1.  **Higher-Quality Noise (`snoise`)**: We've replaced the cheap `rand` function with a full Simplex noise implementation. In WebGL 1, this would be a significant performance cost. WebGL 2's more powerful GPUs handle complex math like this with ease. The result is a shift from sharp, crystalline patterns to smooth, flowing, organic growth.

2.  **Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) for Detail**: Instead of one layer of `sin()` for edge detail, we now loop and layer multiple "octaves" of our high-quality noise. This technique, called fBm, is the standard for creating natural-looking textures like mountains, clouds, and in our case, biological edges. It gives the shape an infinitely complex and evolving boundary that responds directly to `u_trebleLevel`.

3.  **Advanced Coloring with HSV**: GLSL 3.00 es makes it trivial to work with different color spaces. By defining the color with Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV), we can create more musically intuitive mappings. Here, `u_spectralCentroid` (the "brightness" of the sound) directly controls the **Hue**, creating a beautiful, seamless shift from deep blues and purples for bassy sounds to vibrant greens and yellows for treble-heavy sounds.

4.  **Internal Structure**: The old shader was just a glowing line. This version defines a filled `growth_area`. Inside this area, we apply *another* layer of noise to create the appearance of internal cellular structures, giving the organism depth and texture.

5.  **Tonemapping for Richness**: The final color is passed through a tonemapping function (`color / (color + 1.0)`). This is a technique used in modern video games and film to handle high dynamic range (HDR) lighting. It prevents the visual from becoming a washed-out, "clipped" white mess when `u_energyLevel` is high. Instead, colors become more saturated and intense, preserving detail and creating a much richer and more professional look.
